2. Types of image inhancement techniche in DIP.
3. Definition of Negative and positive image.
   Negative image : A negative image is a photographic or         digital image in which the colors and brightness values are 
   inverted from their original values. In a grayscale image, 
   this means that the intensity levels are reversed: what was 
   black becomes white, and what was white becomes black. For 
   color images, each color channel (red, green, and blue) is 
   inverted.

   Positive image : A positive image is a standard 
   representation of an image where the colors and brightness 
   values match the real-world scene or the original image 
   captured by a camera. It is the direct opposite of a 
   negative image. In a positive image, white areas are 
   represented as white, black areas as black, and all other 
   colors are displayed in their true form.
